Traditionally, the manner in which insurance is bought and sold is as follows: A prospective customer has a need to purchase insurance. They either contact an existing agent or use the internet to search for insurance providers that meet their needs. On selecting an agent, the prospective customer will visit the agent's website, where they will be presented with two choices: 1) call the agent, or 2) fill out a contact form to have the agent call them.

The agent is now untethered to assist customers with their policies or to expand their business. 

In today's world, consumers are accustomed to the pace of the internet. What took hours over a phone can now take minutes over the internet. Users want their purchases to follow the Amazon model, and businesses that do not, are considered antiquated and are passed up for the businesses that do. The Insurance industry, is slow to adopt what has become standard practice in virtually all other industries. Yet there are still relatively few brokers and agents that have made this transition. 

Current Agency Management Software solutions are agent focused, in that they provide the agent with the tools necessary to service their customers. This platform is different. By providing a customer focused solution, the customer is given the tools necessary to service their own accounts. The agent is still available to assist the customer with any issues or questions, but the customer
